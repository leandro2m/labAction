# labAction

Import your production network into a lab environment


## Business/Technical Challenge

Reproduce the state of production  network in a lab environment is challeging task for many customers. Many of them do not have resources, availability or even a culture to test new implementation in test environment before applying changes into the production network.

## Proposed Solution

The purpose of this project is to create a simple way to automatically get the configuration, current topologies and routing table from the production network elements and map them into a lab environment for applying new configurations, tests scripts or reproduce failures.
 
This way, we can reduce the probability of failures/outages and reduce the operational costs of the customers.
